### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a second year IT specialist apprentice at <a href = "https://www.cpnv.ch">CPNV</a>. I don't have many projects done yet as I still need to learn the basics, but it'll come with time. I'm currently interested in web development which will be a majority of the courses I'll be undertaking during this year.
